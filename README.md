# DailyCryptoTradingStrategy

#### Introduction/Description
This project explores the development of a daily crypto trading strategy using machine learning techniques. Aimed at traders, financial analysts, and data scientists, the analysis utilizes historical cryptocurrency data to create and test predictive models that can inform daily trading decisions. The goal is to provide insights into effective trading strategies that leverage data-driven approaches to maximize returns and manage risks in the highly volatile crypto market.

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (if using deep learning models)

#### Installation
Follow these steps to get your development environment running:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook DailyCryptoTradingStrategy_sk.ipynb
```
Inside the notebook, execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis from data loading through to model evaluation.

#### Methodology
The methodology for this project is designed to systematically develop and evaluate a daily trading strategy for cryptocurrencies. The steps include:
- **Data Collection:** Historical price data for selected cryptocurrencies is gathered from reliable sources.
- **Data Exploration:** Visual and statistical analysis of the data to understand distributions, trends, and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features to prepare for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that capture relevant market signals and patterns, such as moving averages, volatility measures, and trading volumes.
- **Model Selection:** Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and deep learning models to identify the best performing model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Backtesting:** Simulating the trading strategy on historical data to evaluate potential profitability and risk management effectiveness.

#### Analysis Overview
The analysis pipeline includes:
- **Data Exploration:** Understanding feature distributions, identifying trends, and visualizing price movements.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing it for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that capture relevant market signals and patterns.
- **Model Selection:** Comparing various machine learning algorithms to find the best performer for our specific dataset, including linear regression, decision trees, and deep learning models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Backtesting:** Testing the strategy on historical data to evaluate its potential profitability and risk management effectiveness.

#### Key Insights and Findings
- **Feature Importance:** Certain features such as moving averages and trading volumes were found to be significant predictors of price movements.
- **Algorithm Performance:** Decision trees and deep learning models showed superior performance in capturing complex patterns in the data compared to simpler models like linear regression.
- **Profitability:** The backtesting results indicated that the developed trading strategy could achieve notable returns while managing risk effectively, though performance varied across different market conditions.
- **Risk Management:** Incorporating volatility measures helped in managing the risk, making the strategy more robust during periods of high market fluctuations.
